## What You Need to Do

Five compulsory tasks, one optional challenge for bonus points.

---

### Task 1 — Fix 6 Backend Bugs in `backend/server.js`

The backend has **6 intentional bugs**. Find and fix them all. Your automated tests tell you exactly which ones are still broken.

| # | Location | Bug | Fix |
|---|----------|-----|-----|
| 1 | `server.js` ~line 14 | Wrong default DB password | Change `'wrongpassword'` → `'bugpassword'` |
| 2 | `POST /api/bugs` | Accepts empty/whitespace-only titles without error | Add `if (!title \|\| !title.trim())` → return 400 |
| 3 | `server.js` | `DELETE /api/bugs/:id` not implemented | Add the full DELETE route |
| 4 | `server.js` | `PUT /api/bugs/:id` not implemented | Add the full PUT route (accepts `{ title, status }`) |
| 5 | `server.js` (bottom) | `app.listen()` runs unconditionally — port conflict during tests | Wrap with `if (require.main === module) { app.listen(...) }` |
| 6 | `server.js` (bottom) | `module.exports` commented out — test file can't import the app | Add `module.exports = app;` at the very end |

> **Start with Bug #6.** Until `module.exports = app` exists, 0/7 tests run.
> Fix Bugs #5 and #6 → 3/7 pass. Fix all 6 → 7/7 pass.

---

### Task 2 — Complete the Dockerfiles

Both `backend/Dockerfile` and `frontend/Dockerfile` are skeletons. Implement **multi-stage builds**.

**Backend** (`backend/Dockerfile`):
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Install production dependencies only
FROM node:18-alpine AS deps
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --package-lock-only && npm ci --omit=dev

# Stage 2: Lean production image
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules ./node_modules
COPY . .
EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/Dockerfile`):
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build the React app into static files
FROM node:18-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install --package-lock-only && npm ci
COPY . .
ARG REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:8080
ENV REACT_APP_API_URL=$REACT_APP_API_URL
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve static files
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
RUN npm install -g serve
COPY --from=builder /app/build ./build
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build", "-l", "3000"]
```

> **Why `ARG`/`ENV` in the frontend?**
> `REACT_APP_*` variables are baked into the JavaScript bundle **at build time** (`npm run build`), not at container startup. Passing the backend URL as a Docker build argument is the only way to embed it correctly.

Also create `.dockerignore` in both `backend/` and `frontend/` to exclude `node_modules`, `.env`, and `.git` from the build context.

---

### Task 3 — Complete `docker-compose.yml`

The `docker-compose.yml` is a skeleton. Complete it so all three services run together:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

| Service | Required Config |
|---------|----------------|
| `postgres` | Image `postgres:15-alpine` · env vars · named volume · init script mount (`./database/database.sql`) · healthcheck |
| `backend` | Port `8080:8080` · env vars (`DB_HOST=postgres`, `DB_NAME=bugdb`, `DB_USER=postgres`, `DB_PASSWORD=bugpassword`) · `depends_on: postgres` with `condition: service_healthy` · healthcheck |
| `frontend` | Port `3000:3000` · build arg `REACT_APP_API_URL: http://localhost:8080` · `depends_on: backend` |

> If you change `database.sql` after Postgres has already started, run `docker compose down -v` first.

---

### Task 4 — Complete the CI/CD Pipeline

| File | What it does | Your task |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Runs all tests on every push and PR | Uncomment the frontend test section (clearly marked in the file) |
| `.github/workflows/cd.yml` | Builds Docker images and deploys after merging to `main` | Complete the **4 TODOs** inside the file |

**`cd.yml` — Your 4 TODOs:**

| TODO | What to implement |
|------|-------------------|
| 1 | Log in to Docker Hub using `docker/login-action@v3` with `DOCKER_USERNAME` / `DOCKER_PASSWORD` secrets |
| 2 | Build and push the **backend** image: `your-username/bug-tracker-backend:latest` |
| 3 | Build and push the **frontend** image, passing `REACT_APP_API_URL` as a build argument |
| 4 | Deploy — choose **Option A** (SSH to VPS) or **Option B** (Render.com) |

**Deployment Options:**

| | Option A — VPS / SSH | Option B — Render.com |
|---|---|---|
| How | SSH in and run `docker compose pull && up` | Trigger a deploy hook via `curl` |
| Database | PostgreSQL on your VPS | Render Managed PostgreSQL (free tier) |
| Difficulty | Higher — closest to real production | Lower — good for quick demos |
| Secrets needed | `SSH_HOST`, `SSH_USER`, `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_BACKEND`, `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_FRONTEND` |

**GitHub Secrets to add** (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions):

| Secret | Required For |
|--------|-------------|
| `DOCKER_USERNAME` | Both options |
| `DOCKER_PASSWORD` | Both options |
| `BACKEND_URL` | Both options |
| `SSH_HOST` | Option A only |
| `SSH_USER` | Option A only |
| `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY` | Option A only |
| `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_BACKEND` | Option B only |
| `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_FRONTEND` | Option B only |

---

### Task 5 — GitHub Repository Configuration

**Branch Protection** (Settings → Branches → Add rule):
- Branch pattern: `main`
- ✅ Require a pull request before merging (min. 1 approval)
- ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging (add your CI check)
- ✅ Do not allow bypassing the above settings

**Commit Message Convention** — all commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| `feat:` | `feat: add DELETE /api/bugs/:id endpoint` |
| `fix:` | `fix: wrap app.listen in require.main guard` |
| `ci:` | `ci: add github actions pipeline` |
| `docs:` | `docs: update README with setup steps` |
| `chore:` | `chore: add .dockerignore for backend and frontend` |

---

## Optional Challenge (+10 Bonus Points)

Once you fix all 6 backend bugs, the API fully supports CRUD. However, the **frontend has empty stub functions** for Delete and status updates. Make them work.

Look for `// STUDENT TODO` comments in `frontend/src/App.jsx`.

**Challenge 1 — Delete Button**: Implement `deleteBug(id)` — call `DELETE /api/bugs/:id`, then `fetchBugs()`.

**Challenge 2 — Status Cycle Button**: Implement `cycleStatus(bug)` — cycle `open → in_progress → closed → open` by calling `PUT /api/bugs/:id` with the next status.

Uncomment the challenge tests in `frontend/tests/App.test.jsx` and make them pass. CI must stay green.

---

## Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Backend (requires a running PostgreSQL instance)
cd backend
npm ci
npm test

# Expected results:
#   0 / 7 pass  — before any fixes (Bug #6 blocks all tests)
#   3 / 7 pass  — after fixing Bugs #5 and #6
#   7 / 7 pass  — after fixing all 6 bugs  ✓

# Frontend (no backend needed — fetch is mocked)
cd frontend
npm ci
npm test
# Expected: 7 / 7 pass (always)
```

---

## API Reference

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/bugs` | Return all bugs, newest first |
| `POST` | `/api/bugs` | Create a bug (`{ title }` — must be non-empty) |
| `PUT` | `/api/bugs/:id` | Update title or status (`{ title, status }`) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/bugs/:id` | Delete a bug permanently |
| `GET` | `/health` | Health check — returns `{ status: "healthy" }` |

Valid status values: `open` · `in_progress` · `closed`

## Demo Flow — Fail → Fix → Pass

1. Show the live app running with real data
2. Create a branch, intentionally break a test, push, open a PR → **show CI failing (Red ✗)**
3. Walk through the Actions log — explain which test failed and why; show the PR is blocked from merging
4. Fix the test, push → **show CI passing (Green ✓)**
5. Get team member approval → Team Leader merges the PR
6. Show the CD workflow triggering automatically in the Actions tab
7. Refresh the live app — show the change is now on the production server

> Make a small visible change (e.g., edit the subtitle in `frontend/src/App.jsx`) for Step 7 so the lecturer can see the update without inspecting code.

## Assessment (100%)

| Criteria | Weight |
|----------|--------|
| Functionality (pipeline end-to-end, CI blocks broken code, CD auto-deploys) | 40% |
| Technical Understanding (explain Dockerfile stages, workflow syntax, secrets) | 30% |
| Collaboration (commit history, PR reviews, all members contributed) | 15% |
| Presentation (clear demo, all members speak, 10–15 min) | 15% |
| Optional Challenge bonus | +10 pts |

> **The CI pipeline must fail when tests are broken.** Showing a deliberate Red ✗ run during the demo — then fixing it — earns significant marks.
